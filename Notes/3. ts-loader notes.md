# TS-LOADER

Note: this is done on same folder!

1. `npm i -D typescript ts-loader`

2. create `tsconfig.json`

3. see what is inside the `tsconfig.json`

    - the module is not `commonjs` anymore
    - will be `"es6"`

        > .ts files -> webpack -> ts-loader -> webpack -> bundle

    - `"strict": true`
        - sets noImplicitAny, noImplicitThis, etc. to be ON

4. create `webpack.config.js` if not already, add an entry point

    - created an `entry` point
    - `resolve` was also put added for typescript files ( there will be many more files to import than just `index.ts` that's why we add this | webpack does not resolve with the TS extension so we have to tell it )

5. added `module: { rules: [{ ... }]}`

    - adding loader here!

6. create a `TS` function in `index.ts` file to test if the loader works!

```
const returnAString = (someStr: string): string => {
	return someStr;
};
```

7. `**Incompatibility**` -- can't select other TS versions, I do not get `.vscode` folder

8. Done.
