# `ts-loader`

Webpack will use ts-loader, using TypeScript compiler, and return the bundled code

-   you can find more on ts-loader in GitHub docs

# `babel-loader` + `@babel/preset-typescript` ( this is used by create-react-app + NextJS | configs MUST be configured )

with the preset, it will tell `Babel` how to read `TypeScript`, in includes the `@babel/plugin-transform-typescipt` preset, it will remove TS syntax!

-   it does not type check! It does not use TS compiler to compile code, so run the TS compiler to check for errors

-   though there are limitations with the presets, they are neglible!

**Both are great, valid approaches! We will build both ways!**
