# Starting Webpack basics!

0.  create new folder that is name compatible with `npm`

    -   > / react-plus-typescript

1.  `npm init`

    -   defaults

2.  `npm i -D webpack webpack-cli`

    -   two packages

3.  create `/ src` folder

    -   create `index.js` file | added `alert("Hi")` for test

4.  build script for running app

    -   `"script": { "build": "webpack --mode produciton" }`

5.  `npm run build`

    -   will create `/ dist` folder & `main.js` ( all bundled js files )

6.  create HTML page in `/ dist` folder

    -   `index.html`

    -   open through finder!

    -   in `/ dist` you can open, in `/ src`, it doesn't

7.  `npm i -D html-webpack-plugin`

    -   create config file for webpack!

8.  `webpack.config.js` file

    -   look at it! you made this config file

9.  by configuring the webpack config, we can `npm run build` and will build the js file with HtmlWebpackPlugin add ons!

10. `npm i -D webpack-dev-server`

    so we can test app locally on machine + updates the file code and rebuilds the app, updating the browser!

    `"start": "webpack serve --mode development --open 'google chrome'",`,this is updated!, webpack-dev-server does not work anymore!

    -   `webpack` and `webpack-cli` modules have been updated. `Webpack` released version 5 and `webpack-cli` is version 4.
    -   So, using latest versions, you should run webpack dev server using `webpack serve`:

11. `.gitignore`

    -   dist
    -   node_modules
